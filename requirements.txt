Requirements
-------
List of the Python libraries and dependencies that are necessary for the project to run correctly. 

**Flask:** For building the API (if you are using Flask as the web framework).
**Pytest:** For running unit tests.
**SQLite3**: For database interactions (although it comes built-in with Python, it may be mentioned for clarity).

```txt

Flask==2.3.2
pytest==7.4.0
sqlite3==0.9.6

```
Can also easily install all the dependencies with a single command:

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
